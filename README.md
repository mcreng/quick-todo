# quick-todo

This project is originated from the tutorial [here](https://dev.to/nbrempel/using-react-firebase-and-ant-design-to-quickly-prototype-web-applications-3hpa?utm_source=digest_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=digest_email). The aims are to 

- familiarize with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework
- familiarize with React UI framework [AntDesign](https://ant.design/)
- familiarize with integrating [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) into websites, in particular in this case database
- refine my skills on building responsive websites

At this stage, this project is considered finished. New and more complicated projects will start soon.
